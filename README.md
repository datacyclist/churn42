_Predicting churn in telco industry_

I have been tasked to have a deeper look into that problem and in particular to
predict churn for the next quarter (Q3 2021). In other words, the task consists
in identifying which customers are most likely going to churn in the next
quarter. By doing so, the company can proactively do its best to avoid
customers from churning - by for instance proposing customers with a better
deal.
